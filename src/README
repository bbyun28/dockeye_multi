dockeyeM_energy.c  C code backend interaction energy compute engine
dockeyeM_energy.so  shared object file compiled from dockeye_energy.c
                   as an importable Python module
dockeyeM_c_vX.Y.py  version X.Y python code run within PyMol, which 
                   implements the graphical front end. Imports the
                   module dockeye_energy from dockeye_energy.so
                   to run the backend
dockeyeM_c.py       logical link to specific version code, link to this
                   file should be placed in your PyMol installation's
                   external package dynamic load directory,
                   ...pymol....something/lib-dynload
dockeyeM_getpose.py extracts low energy ligand poses from the dockeye
                   logfile into a pdb format file
make_conformers.py generates a ligand *.atm file for use with dockeye_multi
                   from a vina autodock *.pdbqt
                   file containing multiple ligand conformers based
                   on rotations around torsions specified in pdbqt file
