===============================
dockeye_multi is an interactive graphical tool 
to dock small ligands/drugs to proteins
It works as a plugin to PyMol,
which is used as a graphic rendering engine.

===============================
directories:
===============================
src (source files, shared object file, makefile)
 sub_directories src_c, src_f contain the C and
 Fortran versions of the dockeye backend. The C version
 is full operational. The Fortran version is a straight
 translation using f2py, but lags a version behind the c. 
 (i.e. may not have the latest widget)
 Both produce a module importable into Python 
 The C version has been tested and works for PyMol
 distros 1.9-2.2 running Python2.7 on Linux, MacOS
 The FORTRAN version has been tested and works for PyMol2.2
 distros running Python3.6/7 on Linux, MacOS

example (all files needed to run the examples 
 trypsin/benzamidine, interleukin and antibody_digoxin)
